This file uses a workflow developed by the DFW creel dev crew to summarize and generate creel estimates (angler effort, catch, and catch per unit effort (cpue)) from freshwater monitoring data housed on data.wa.gov, using direct expansion estimators (see Kale Bentley's original creel analysis files, Pollock et al. 1994).

Pieces of the script require user / analysis specific inputs, including the initial parameters in the YAML, specification of closure / river out days in the dates section, specification of days with assumed cpue values (when there was known angling effort, but no corresponding interview), catch groups to retain for estimates, and ... ?

# get raw data

The data used are from the `r params$proj_name` project on the `r params$water_body` between `r params$date_start` and `r params$date_end`.

Further development may include interactive control parameter specification via the GUI: [https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/params-knit.html#the-interactive-user-interface]

There is also the option to step through multiple pre-defined control parameters:
[https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/parameterized-reports.html]

## creel events

First, get the creel events of interest by building the Socrata API url string and grabbing the data

```{r get_event, include = FALSE}
dwg_sent$event <- URLencode(
  paste0(dwg_base$event,
         "?$where=project_name in('", params$proj_name, "')",
         " AND water_body in('", str_replace(params$water_body, ",|\\|", "','"), "')",
         " AND event_date between '", params$date_start,
         "T00:00:00' and '", params$date_end,
         "T00:00:00'&$limit=100000"
  )
)

creel$event <- read_csv(dwg_sent$event) |> 
  dplyr::select(creel_event_id, water_body, event_date, tie_in_indicator)

```

Then, get the associated effort and interview data.

```{r pending_vw_changes_for_water_body, include = FALSE}
# #if water_body dropped from event filter...
# #but regardless can/should build creel_event_id condition once and apply twice?
# eff_int_filter <- paste0(
#     "?$where=creel_event_id in('",
#     paste(creel$event$creel_event_id, collapse = "','"), "')",
#     " AND water_body in('", str_replace(params$water_body, ",|\\|", "','"), "')",
#     "&$limit=100000"
#   )

```

## effort counts

```{r get_effort, include = FALSE}
dwg_sent$effort <- URLencode(
  paste0(dwg_base$effort,
         "?$where=creel_event_id in('",
         paste(creel$event$creel_event_id, collapse = "','"),
         "')&$limit=100000"
  )
)

creel$effort <- read_csv(dwg_sent$effort) |> 
  filter(!is.na(count_type))

```

## interviews

```{r get_interview, include = FALSE}
dwg_sent$interview <- URLencode(
  paste0(dwg_base$interview,
         "?$where=creel_event_id in('",
         paste(creel$event$creel_event_id, collapse = "','"),
         "')&$limit=100000"
  )
)

creel$interview <- read_csv(dwg_sent$interview) |> 
  rename(location = interview_location)

```

## catch data

And finally, the catch data associated with the interviews.

```{r get_catch, include = FALSE}
dwg_sent$catch <- URLencode(
  paste0(dwg_base$catch,
         "?$where=creel_event_id in('",
         paste(creel$event$creel_event_id, collapse = "','"),
         "')&$limit=100000"
  )
)


creel$catch <- read_csv(dwg_sent$catch) 

creel$catch <- creel$catch |> 
  dplyr::select(interview_id, catch_id, species, run, life_stage, fin_mark, fate, fish_count) |> 
  mutate(
    life_stage = replace_na(life_stage, "Adult"), # placeholder pending data corrections in fish apps 
    catch_group = paste(species, life_stage, fin_mark, fate, sep = "_") # fish catch groups to estimate catch of 
  )
  
```



## sections

Aggregations of `location` units that depend on `r params$section` lookup table.

**NOTE ANY DATA THAT ARE NOT ASSIGNED TO A SECTION WILL BE EXCLUDED**

```{r add_sections, include = FALSE}
creel$effort <- creel$effort |> 
  select(-created_datetime, -modified_datetime) |>
  left_join(
    lut$sections |> select(water_body_desc, location = location_code, section),
    by = c("location")
    ) |> 
  filter(!is.na(section))

creel$interview <- creel$interview |> 
  select(-created_datetime, -modified_datetime,
         -state_residence, -zip_code) |> 
  left_join(
    lut$sections |> select(water_body_desc, location = location_code, section),
    by = c("location")
  ) |> 
  filter(!is.na(section))

```



# prepare data for catch and effort calculations

```{r init_point_estimate_data_prelim, include = FALSE}
#declare an intermediary list

point_estimate_data_prelim <- list(
  effort_census = creel$effort |> filter(tie_in_indicator == 1),
  effort_index = creel$effort |> filter(tie_in_indicator == 0),
  interview = creel$interview
)

```


## dates ** user inputs for fishery closures / "river out" days ** 

First, build an "expanded dates lattice" to which any/all observations are attached, ensuring complete cases.

Start with presumption that all dates are open, then join per-section closures by date.

```{r d_days, include = FALSE}
#creel$event |> distinct(event_date)
d_days <- tibble(
  event_date = seq(
    as.Date(params$date_start, "%Y-%m-%d"),
    as.Date(params$date_end, "%Y-%m-%d"),
    by = "day")
) |> 
  mutate(
    Day = weekdays(event_date),
    DayType = if_else(Day == "Saturday" | Day == "Sunday" | Day %in% dates_holidays_2015_2030, "Weekend", "Weekday"),
    DayType_num = if_else(str_detect(DayType, "end"),1,0),
    DayL = suncalc::getSunlightTimes(
      date = event_date,
      tz = "America/Los_Angeles",
      #need to add flexibility for other rivers/multiple lines in River.Locations lut
      lat = lut$river_loc$Lat,

    ) |> 
      mutate(DayL = as.numeric(dusk - dawn)) |>
      pluck("DayL"),
    Week = as.numeric(format(event_date, "%V")),
    Month = as.numeric(format(event_date, "%m")),
    ModelPeriod = params$model_period) |>

  #make open section cols (only those actually used, not all in LU)
  left_join(
    expand_grid(

        as.Date(params$date_start, "%Y-%m-%d"),
        as.Date(params$date_end, "%Y-%m-%d"),
        by = "day")
      ,
      s = paste0("open_section_", sort(unique(point_estimate_data_prelim$effort_index$section)))

      separate_rows(closure_date, sep = ",") |>
      select(event_date = closure_date, section) |>
      mutate(
        event_date = as.Date(event_date),
        closure_code = FALSE # TB - The 1e-06 is needed to keep the model from crashing ?log-normal parameters cant be 0
      ) |>
      separate_rows(section, sep = ",") |>
      pivot_wider(names_from = section, names_prefix = "open_section_", values_from = closure_code) |>
      mutate(across(starts_with("open_section_"), ~replace_na(., TRUE)))

## Skagit winter gamefish example also shows valid realworld situation
## section 1 has 'Vehicle Only' counts but not 'Trailers Only' due to low angler effort

# daily estimates of effort 

Here calculating estimates of daily effort (angler-hours) from vehicle / trailer counts (index counts) and angler group data (interviews), following methods used in North Puget Sound creels. 

An exception to this is the Cascade River, where only vehicles get counted, since there's no boat angling / access on the 1 mile long fishery.

Length of stay bias occurs when anglers who fish longer are more likely to be interviewed and their resulting information is unequally weighted when calculating CPUE.
