# creates summary table of census expansion factors based on values in data base

#NOTE: "p_census is the same as "p_TI" in the BSS model, which represent a known or assumed proportion of each section covered by tie-in counts for each final angler-type; this parameter is used to directly expand/modify the census count data prior to the estimate of the bias parameter/expansion factor
#NOTE: values of "p_census/p_TI" are entered and stored in creel db
#NOTE: currently, values of "p_census/p_TI" are limited to two "angler_final" groupings (bank, boat)
