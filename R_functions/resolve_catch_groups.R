#' Resolve catch groups for estimation
#'
#' Dynamically source fishery catch groups from the Postgres creel database.
#' By default the script param `est_catch_groups` is blank quotes ("") and the
#' model catch group view (vw_model_catch_group) is queried via
#' `creelutils::fishery_catchgroups()`, returning the component fields alongside
#' `combined_catch_group` and `model_catch_group_id`. Users can optionally enter
#' catch groups manually as a data frame of the four component fields (atomic or
#' combined with `|`), which always overrides the database and is passed through
#' verbatim with no database contact — correct formatting of manual entries is
#' the user's responsibility. Aborts when catch groups are blank and the
#' database lookup fails or returns no defined groups.
#'
#' @details
#' A fully specified manual entry requires no database connectivity, mirroring
#' `resolve_dates()`. Catch group ids are joined at upload time in
#' `creelutils::prep_export()` (where a live connection is required regardless); 
#' manually entered groups not previously defined in the Creel App at
#' <https://apps.wdfw-fish.us/> are warned and skipped at upload, but estimate
#' normally.
#'
#' @param fishery character; must match a fishery_lut row when catch groups are blank
#' @param catch_groups "" (query the database) or a data frame with columns
#'   species, life_stage, fin_mark, fate
#' @param observed_only logical; passed to `creelutils::fishery_catchgroups()` on the 
#' blank path to restrict to catch groups with observed catch. Default FALSE.
#' @param conn A valid database connection from `creelutils::connect_creel_db()`.
#'   Optional with NULL default; `creelutils::fishery_catchgroups()` opens and closes 
#'   a lazy connection internally when NULL. Unused on the manual path.
